A project I also got its dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor/data)

I followed normal pre-processing protocol - know the data

1. Firstly, I cheked the information of the data and found out that there are no missing data and all column datatypes are correct
2. I skimmed through the excel sheet first to understand the information and most of it had unique charcters and stuff so i had to use 'encode' when importing the data
3. Found if each column had unique values
4. Dropped unncessary columns
5. Cleaned columns by replacing values with correct ones
6. After making sure everything is done, I checked for duplicates adn re-indexed then dropped nulls (no reason for now)
7. Converted to excel
